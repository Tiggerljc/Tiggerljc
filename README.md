## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tigger, a Lego MOC designer and wannabe game creator.

- I like to make MOCs and post them on Rebrickable
- I enjoy game creation using Unreal Engine
- I'm currently working on creating my first game in Unreal Engine (it is in the early development process)
- I'm currently working on setting up Visual Studio with Unreal Engine, but I'm having many difficulties.
